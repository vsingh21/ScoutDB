<strong>FBLA 2023-24 Coding and Programming Topic</strong><br>
Create a program that allows your schoolâ€™s Career and Technical Education Department to
collect and store information about business and community partners. This program should
include information on at least 25 different partners (real or fictional), with details such as,
but not limited to, the type of organization, resources available, and direct contact
information for an individual. The program should enable users to search and filter the
information as needed.
